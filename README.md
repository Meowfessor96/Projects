# Personal Projects Portfolio

A collection of my hardware and signal processing projects built using core electrical and electronics concepts. Each project has its own folder with source files, documentation, and related code or circuit diagrams.

### ðŸ“¦ Projects

- [**5-Bit SAR ADC DAC**](./5-bit-sar-adc-dac/)  
  Built a 5-bit successive approximation ADC to convert analog voltages to digital values with moderate precision.

- [**FM Transmitter**](./fm-transmitter/)  
  Designed and implemented a low-power FM transmitter using an IC to broadcast audio over a specific frequency range.

- [**Audio Amplifier**](./audio-amplifier/)  
  Built an audio amplifier circuit with volume control using a potentiometer for real-time analog gain adjustment.

- [**7-Segment Digital Clock**](./7-segment-digital-clock/)  
  Constructed a digital clock in `HH:MM:SS` format using D flip-flops, a BCD decoder, and an Arduino for time control and display.

- [**Mobile DC Charger**](./mobile-dc-charger/)  
  Converted AC input to regulated DC output to successfully charge a mobile phone using rectifier circuitry.

- [**Digital Noise Filter**](./digital-noise-filter/)  
  Designed a real-time digital filter using the NLMS algorithm, achieving a 20 dB reduction in signal noise ratio.

- [**Wireless Solar Mobile Charger**](./wireless-solar-mobile-charger/)  
  Created a wireless charger using solar power, magnetic induction, and rectification principles to charge mobile devices without a physical connection.
